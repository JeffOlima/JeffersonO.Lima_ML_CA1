Using one-hot encoding, it first converts the categorical feature \"Action\" into numerical values, generating binary columns for each category. Then, in order to ensure equal scales, it scales the numerical characteristics using StandardScaler, which can enhance the efficiency of various classification methods. Following data preparation, the dataset is divided in an 80-20 ratio into training and testing sets. The output, which displays the shapes of the training and testing sets for both features and the target variable, validates that the dataset was successfully split. There are 52,425 samples with 11 features in the training set and 13,107 samples with 11 features in the testing set.In the same way, the testing set has dimensions (13,107, 4) while the training set's target variable has dimensions (52,425, 4), which reflect the one-hot encoded categories. The produced datasets can now be used for model evaluation and training."

    "#### The following code predicts the action for a new set of input data using the trained K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. The input data X_new represents a single observation with specific features. The predict method of the knn_classifier model is used to predict the action based on the input data. The output [1 0 0 0] indicates that the model predicts with high confidence that the action will be \"allow,\" as the first element has a probability of 1, while the other elements have probabilities of 0."
